# QUAM Quantum Components API

Welcome to the QUAM Quantum Components API Documentation.
The QUAM Quantum Components module provides high-level abstractions for qubits and qubit pairs, enabling gate-level quantum programming.
Information can be found in [QUAM Gate-Level Operations Documentation](/features/gate-level-operations) in the User Guide.

This section provides detailed API references for quantum component classes—including qubits and qubit pairs—that allow you to work at the gate level rather than the pulse level, bringing your quantum control code closer to quantum circuit thinking.
